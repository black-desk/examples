## D-Bus

Some How-to-X examples of D-Bus IPC protocol.

### How to create and connect to peer-to-peer message bus

This is an example project to show how to write a D-Bus service and a
client with QDBus communicating with each other via peer-to-peer message
bus.

  point](D-Bus/create_and_connect_to_peer-to-peer_message_bus/apps/server/src/main.cpp)
- [Client source entry
  point](D-Bus/create_and_connect_to_peer-to-peer_message_bus/apps/client/src/main.cpp)

### How to get credentials of method caller

This is an example project to show how to get `UID`, `GID`, `PID` and
Linux security labels of method caller as a D-Bus service implemented
with QDBus and `sd_bus`.

- [Server source entry
  point](D-Bus/get_credentials_of_method_caller/apps/server/src/main.cpp)
- [Server source entry point implemented by
  `sd_bus`](D-Bus/get_credentials_of_method_caller/apps/server-sd_bus/src/main.cpp)
- [Client source entry
  point](D-Bus/get_credentials_of_method_caller/apps/client/src/main.cpp)
